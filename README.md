# The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Service Industry

## Overview

My capstone explores the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the service industry, specifically: 

 - The rate of unemployment of service industry workers due to COVID in comparison to the general population.

 - Service industry jobs lost in comparison to other industries.

 - Are restauraunt workers returning to restaurant jobs? 

## Motivation

I decided to focus on how the pandemic affected the service industry due to my own personal experience. I spent many years working in restaurants, and I myself was 
laid off in April of 2020 due to the effects of COVID and the initial shutdown of businesses. This led me to making the decision to make a career change and go down the 
path of data analytics.
